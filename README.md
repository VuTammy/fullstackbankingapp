# Full Stack Banking Application
### This is the capstone project for MIT xPro Full stack development with MERN

### Description/Purpose
The instructions for this assignment was to create a three tier full stack "Bad Bank" application. The Bank Bank website inlcudes:

1. Tier 1 - Front end: A home page and a navigation bar that allows the user to switch between pages. There is a create account and login page where the user can input their information to get started. There is a deposit and withdraw function that adds and subtracts money from the users balance. There is a balance page that allows the user to check their current account balance. There is a transfer function that lets the user send and receive money. And lastly, there is an "All Data" page where all user information is stored. 

2. Tier 2 - Back end API: Node.js, npm, and ‘routes’ which leads to different pages throughout the website. The front-end is connected a database, making it a 3-tier application. 

3. Tier 3 - Back end database: lowdb
